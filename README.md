## Setup

1. **Clone the repository and navigate to the root directory.**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nAuTahn/eMI-BBO
    cd eMI-BBO
    ```
2. **Make sure to install the required libraries. Besides [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), you also need [SciPy](https://scipy.org/) to perform some calculations.**

## **Performance evaluation on standard MIP benchmark functions.**
You can reproduce the results in our paper by running the following scripts. Hyperparameters can be adjusted based on the papers or customized by the user.
```bash
python test.py --func ellipsoid_int --dim 120  --dim_co 80 --max_evals 100000 --target 1e-10 --sigma_VD 0.5 --sigma_NES 0.5 --step_size_control "TPA"
```
Another argument `--list_funcs` is added to support displaying the names of some available benchmark functions. Additionally, users can add other objective functions in `test.py` for evaluation.
